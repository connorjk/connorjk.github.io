<h1>Connor J.</h1>
<p>That Wednesday in October

You ask me “Do you ever wonder had what our lives would be like had we not met?”
I look at the screen in front of me, words transmitted to me from miles away, 
perhaps as fast as they would have fallen from your lips. 
The keyboard makes this easy. “Of course I do, darling. So glad to have met you.” 
What you don’t know is that I think about it every night. 
What you don’t know is that you saved me;
You saved me that Wednesday in October. 

I’m no strangers to those three words that mean so much to so many. 
This, perhaps, you do know. That I’ve loved and been loved. 
If you could see my heart, you’d see the cut that those words have left. 
You could see what love did to me-
You could guess at my thoughts on the matter. 
At the time? Bullshit. Absolute and utterly a waste of time and feelings. 
You changed that after that Wednesday in October.
